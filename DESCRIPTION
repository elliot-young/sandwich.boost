Description: A boosting methodology to determine accurate weighted estimates of the linear coefficient in grouped partially linear models.
    The linear component is estimated by first regressing a response and treatment (whose linear effect is of interest) on covariates using a chosen non-parametric / machine learning method, and then carrying out a subsequent weighted linear regression using these residuals. Weights are determined by minimising the sandwich loss objective with a choice of base learners for boosting over a given working covaraince model.
    Details of the method can be found in Elliot H. Young and Rajen D. Shah (2023).
